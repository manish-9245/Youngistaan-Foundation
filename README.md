# Youngistaan-Foundation
Made for JPMC CFG-2021  
## THE ISSUE  
We observed that the volunteers who were being registered didn't have a specific portal to track their progress and to be up to date with the recent activities taking place in the events/organization. In addition, there wasn't a properly moderated blogging system or an event-specific chat system to enhance the communication between volunteers and coordinators.  
## OUR MAGIC SOLUTION  
We came up with a one-stop integrated solution that shall help the foundation in dealing with the above-mentioned challenges. We came up with an admin/coordinator moderated blogging system to ensure that only the right content goes up on the page. By including a leaderboard in the website, volunteers are motivated to give their best and thereby creating a positive impact on the society as a whole.  
## HOW IT WORKS  
-Awards & User Profile  
A system of awards has been implemented to encourage user engagement.  
 
-Leaderboard for Volunteers  
Leaderboard which shows the volunteers that have been the most active, this step is again to encourage user engagement and interaction.  

-Blog App  
We have also added in a blog application, where in a user can publish blogs under the supervision of the administrator. This is a way to share their experience with the other volunteers.  
  
-Admin/Coordinator Dashboard  
The above picture shows the admin dashboard created solely for data analytics. With the help of user friendly visualization, the admin can analyze various kinds of activity on the platform.  
  
-Event Specific Chat App  
A chat app has been created which provides a chat room for every event where in the coordinators can send in announcements and alerts to the volunteers who have enrolled in that particular event
